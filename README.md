ps4-exploit-host-on-Assuswrt-Merlin
================

## What is this?
- Initially this will be a guide on how setup ps4-exploit-host on a router running Asuswrt-Merlin. Future plan will be to make it all automated and script based.

- Eventhough it branches off "Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host", intention is not to change the source code; not at least at the moment.

## Requirements
- Owning ASUS router running Asuswrt-Merlin. Refer to https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/ and https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin

## Where is the guide?
- Check out "Wiki" page.

## I am facing issues:
- Check out "Troubleshooting" page under "Wiki"

## Why not use fake DNS that comes with PS Host
- At the moment, DNS port (53) has been hardcoded into fake DNS. To keep setup as simple and easy as possible, no code change has been done in the guide; only setting changes. 
- A feature request has been submitted to Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host to have DNS port in the settings, similar to HTTP port. After that has been done, guide will be updated to even make the process easier by using fake DNS.
