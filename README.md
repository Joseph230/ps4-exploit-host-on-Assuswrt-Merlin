ps4-exploit-host-on-Asuswrt-Merlin
================

## What is this?
- Initially this will be a guide on how setup ps4-exploit-host on a router running Asuswrt-Merlin. Future plan will be to make it all automated and script based.

- Eventhough it branches off "Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host", intention is not to change the source code; not at least at the moment.

## Why not other already available guids?
This method is different that other methods out there:

- All the other methods that I checked, were done on tomato/ddwrt.
- All the other methods, change http port of router's GUI to something different than 80 (e.g 8080, 7777, ...). Therefore one needs to have that port entered into browser whenever they need to access the GUI of router.
- Asuswer-Merlin firmware does not let port change for main GUI; apparently only 443 (https) works in some cases.
- This guide aims to do minimum change on main settings of router.

## Requirements
- Owning ASUS router running Asuswrt-Merlin. Refer to https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/ and https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin

## Where is the guide?
- Check out ["Wiki"](https://github.com/YouEbr/ps4-exploit-host-on-Asuswrt-Merlin/wiki) page.

## I am facing issues:
- Check out ["Troubleshooting"](https://github.com/Joseph230/ps4-exploit-host-on-Assuswrt-Merlin/wiki/Troubleshooting) page under "Wiki"

## Why not use fake DNS that comes with ps4-exploit-host?
- At the moment, DNS port (53) has been hardcoded into fake DNS. To keep setup as simple and easy as possible, no code change has been done in the guide; only setting changes. 
- A feature request has been submitted to Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host to have DNS port in the settings, similar to HTTP port. After that has been done, guide will be updated to even make the process easier by using fake DNS.
