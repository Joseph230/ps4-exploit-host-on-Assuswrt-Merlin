ps4-exploit-host-on-Asuswrt-Merlin
================

## What is this?
- Initially this will be a guide on how setup ps4-exploit-host on a router running Asuswrt-Merlin. Future plan will be to make it all automated and script based.

- Even though it branches off "Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host", intention is not to change the source code; not at least at the moment.

## Why not other already available guids?
This method is different that other methods out there:

- All the other methods that I checked, were done on tomato/ddwrt.
- All the other methods, change http port of router's GUI to something different than 80 (e.g 8080, 7777, ...). Therefore one needs to have that port entered into browser whenever they need to access the GUI of router.
- Asuswer-Merlin firmware does not let port change for main GUI; apparently only 443 (https) works in some cases.
- This guide aims to do minimum change on main settings of router.

## Requirements
- Owning ASUS router running Asuswrt-Merlin. Refer to https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/ and https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin

## Where is the guide?
- Check out ["Wiki"](https://github.com/YouEbr/ps4-exploit-host-on-Asuswrt-Merlin/wiki) page. There you'll find the [main guide](https://github.com/YouEbr/ps4-exploit-host-on-Asuswrt-Merlin/wiki/Al-Azif's-ps4-exploit-host-on-ASUS-router-running-Asuswrt-Merlin) and more.

## It is not working! :'( :

*** 

#### Version 1 vs. Version 2/2.1 

- [Version 1.0](https://github.com/YouEbr/ps4-exploit-host-on-Asuswrt-Merlin/releases/tag/V1.0) was using old code in which DNS port (53) was hardcoded in fake DNS. Hence, version 1 guide was utilizing DNS server of the router.

- [Version 2.1.1](https://github.com/YouEbr/ps4-exploit-host-on-Asuswrt-Merlin/releases/tag/V2.1.1) uses new code in which DNS port can be configured.

Side effects/drawbacks of version 1:

1- URL blocking was applied to any IP address(e.g. your laptop). Version 2 resolves that issue by only blocking the traffic coming from PS4.

2- You had to configure the DNS server of the router to its IP address (192.168.1.1). That prevents you from configuring public and desired DNS servers on the router (e.g. OpenDNS). Version 2 does not have this limitation.
