ps4-exploit-host-on-Assuswrt-Merlin
================

## What is this?
- Initially this will be a guide to how setup ps4-exploit-host on Asuswrt-Merlin. Future plan will be to make it all automated and script based.

- Eventhough it branches off "Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host", intention is nto to change the source code; nto at least at the moment.

## Requirements
- Owning ASUS router running Asuswrt-Merlin. Refer to https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/ and https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin
